This is a creation of a web-based etch-a-sketch.  As the user hovers over the
cells in the grid, they will fill in with color.  Black is the default color
upon loading the page.

Clicking the color button will reset the grid to all white and cause cells to fill in 
with a randomly chosen color. Clicking it again will change it back to black & white.

Clicking the reset button will prompt the user for a width, which will create a new 
square grid with the input width. If no width is input, the width will default to 16.
The color will also reset on a 'reset' and will start with black.
